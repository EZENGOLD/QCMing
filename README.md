# QCMing
QCM Game in C++

## Project for C++ class courses application
This project has been developed in CodeBlock environment. It uses the **"windows.h"** library, so it runs only in *Windows OS*. To use the project in *Linux OS*, clone it and try to find the appropriate modules corresponding to each one used in "windows.h".

## Installation
**To run the project, please follow theses steps !**

1. Download [codeblocks-20.03mingw-setup.exe](https://www.fosshub.com/Code-Blocks.html?dwl=codeblocks-20.03mingw-setup.exe). Be careful ! I suggest to take the version which wrap the MinGV compiler in to start quickly.

2. Install the binary package you just download. 
    #### If not compiler has been detected by default, you can follow theses steps
    * Go to **Settings>Compiler>Toolchain executable**
    * Verify that the *Compiler's installation directory* is the right one. On Windows, it should be located in ***C:\Programme Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\bin*** or ***C:\Programme Files\CodeBlocks\MinGW\bin***
    * If the path is not correct, you can then change it to the right one

3. Now that you ensure Codeblock is correctly installed, you can open the project.
    * Clone the repository
    * In Codeblock, go to **File** and **Open...**
    * Choose in the project repository the [QCMing.cbp](#QCMing/QCMing.cbp) and Open it
    * The project should now be opened

4. Go to **Build>Build** to compile the project

5. You can then run the project and enjoy.
